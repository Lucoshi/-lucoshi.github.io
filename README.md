## What is this?
This is part of my personal digital time capsule, Gaming Land Archive where I want it to be like the Homestar Runner wiki: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaBbMnoA0ak
## Why are you doing this?
For preservation, also because there are a lot of troublesome trolls in preservation discord servers!
## May I help you?
Of course, Why not!
## Anything you have done?
