      <font face="verdana,helvetica,arial" size="2">Donkey Kong 64 is a
3D adventure game starring one of the world's most famous gorillas.
Remember the classic Donkey Kong arcade game where you had to jump your
way to the top? Boy has Donkey Kong come a long way since then! In
Donkey Kong 64, players get to control five different monkeys in an
amazing quest to save the DK Isles from King K. Rool.<br>
      <br>
Donkey Kong 64 is fun for players of all ages. Experienced gamers will
be challenged by intricate puzzles and aggressive enemies, while
younger players will simply enjoy exploring the eye-poppingly beautiful
worlds of the DK Isles. On top of that, Donkey Kong 64 features a great
multiplayer mode which allows up to four players to experience the
insane action simultaneously (players must unlock at least one Kong
before this mode is available).<br>
      <br>
Donkey Kong 64 has earned an "E" (everyone) rating by the independent
Entertainment Software Rating Board. Games rated "E" are suitable for
persons age six or older.<br>
      <br>
Players can save their progress directly to the Game Pak without the
use of the N64 Controller Pak. If players choose, the N64 Rumble Pak
can be used to shake things up. Donkey Kong 64 requires the use of the
N64 Expansion Pak, which is packaged with every Game Pak.<br>
      <br>

Green N64 console system, a Jungle Green Controller and an N64

      <br>
