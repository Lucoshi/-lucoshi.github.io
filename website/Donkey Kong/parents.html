Donkey Kong 64 is a 3D adventure game starring one of the world's most famous gorillas. Remember the classic Donkey Kong arcade game where you had to jump your way to the top? Boy has Donkey Kong come a long way since then! In Donkey Kong 64, players get to control five different monkeys in an amazing quest to save the DK Isles from King K. Rool.<br><br>

Donkey Kong 64 is fun for players of all ages. Experienced gamers will be challenged by intricate puzzles and aggressive enemies, while younger players will simply enjoy exploring the eye-poppingly beautiful worlds of the DK Isles. On top of that, Donkey Kong 64 features a great multiplayer mode which allows up to four players to experience the insane action simultaneously (players must unlock at least one Kong before this mode is available).<br><br>

Donkey Kong 64 has earned an "E" (everyone) rating by the independent Entertainment Software Rating Board. Games rated "E" are suitable for persons age six or older.<br><br>

Players can save their progress directly to the Game Pak without the use of the N64 Controller Pak. If players choose, the N64 Rumble Pak can be used to shake things up. Donkey Kong 64 requires the use of the N64 Expansion Pak, which is packaged with every Game Pak.<br><br>
